Bi-weekly housekeeping, safety-enhanced bathrooms, and 24-hour medical response services ensure you will enjoy hassle-free living with peace of mind. \r\n\r\nBesides the convenience to local and regional shopping and dining options, residents will enjoy chef prepared meals and a wide array of daily activities, events, and classes.

Doctors and nurses are also available right within the community, and the range of care includes personalized nursing and a memory care wing with secure rooms and outdoor spaces. \r\n\r\nTownhomes at Dunwoody range from 2,105 square feet to 4,125 square feet and include two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, open floor plans, gas stoves and fireplaces, covered patios, two-car garages, and more than enough storage space. Apartment options include a studio, a junior bedroom, a one-bedroom or two-bedroom layout, and all have spacious closets and personal temperature controls.\r\n\r\nResidents enjoy the tranquil views from their residences and the quiet surroundings, and the campus includes activity rooms, a heated pool, a jacuzzi, and a fitness center with a personal trainer. Meals can be enjoyed in a formal dining room, a casual dining area, or a takeout menu. One daily meal is included for each resident, with an option to purchase additional meals.\r\n\r\nFully enclosed, heated walkways make it easy to enjoy activities at the community building, even when the weather is cold, and the campus is supported by generators if the power goes out. The property offers emergency call systems and 24-hour security for added peace of mind.",

Founded with Quaker values of inclusion for all faiths, dignity, respect, and diversity, residents will find a warm and caring community. There are 10 spacious floor plans for apartments and homes on the property, with studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom options for residents. \r\n\r\nResidents will find many of the comforts and features they’ve grown to love in their own homes, including draperies, solid surface countertops, an over-the-range microwave, a dishwasher in many homes and a washer/dryer in all. There’s no shortage of space, from expanded closets to the options of patios or balconies on homes.  \r\n\r\nActivities include walking or biking on the many trails, Tai Chi classes, yoga classes, and swimming in a 60 foot lap pool or a warm-water exercise pool. A fitness center includes personalized programs and guidance from fitness instructors. \r\n\r\nAn interdenominational church service is provided each week, while rides to area churches are also provided. When residents require additional care and support, geriatricians and nurse practitioners will help provide a plan for the care each one requires, ensuring they have their needs met without increasing their costs.",

          "description": "Generously apportioned living areas and 82 acres of scenic paths and trails make Pennswood Village a truly unique Continuing Care Retirement Community in Newtown, PA. Founded with Quaker values of inclusion for all faiths, dignity, respect, and diversity, residents will find a warm and caring community. There are 10 spacious floor plans for apartments and homes on the property, with studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom options for residents. \r\n\r\nResidents will find many of the comforts and features they’ve grown to love in their own homes, including draperies, solid surface countertops, an over-the-range microwave, a dishwasher in many homes and a washer/dryer in all. There’s no shortage of space, from expanded closets to the options of patios or balconies on homes.  \r\n\r\nActivities include walking or biking on the many trails, Tai Chi classes, yoga classes, and swimming in a 60 foot lap pool or a warm-water exercise pool. A fitness center includes personalized programs and guidance from fitness instructors. \r\n\r\nAn interdenominational church service is provided each week, while rides to area churches are also provided. When residents require additional care and support, geriatricians and nurse practitioners will help provide a plan for the care each one requires, ensuring they have their needs met without increasing their costs.",
